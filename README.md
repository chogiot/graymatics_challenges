## Problem 1:
This is the knapsack problem where the code needs to pick the right objects by taking into account:
1. not to exceed the max weight
2. to maximise the value
In this problem there are some examples of items to be picked and the outcome should be the maximised value.
### Usage:
```
python3 graymatics_prob_1.py
```
Items are inside the code, therefore there is no need for user input.


## Problem 2:
In this problem we need to ensure that
1. open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets and
2. open brackets must be closed in the correct order
The outcome should be a boolean if those conditions are met.

### Usage:
```
python3 graymatics_prob_2.py '( ) [ ] { }'
```
There is need for user input


## Problem 3:
In this problem I need to feed a video in the code and make a clip from this video from 00:30 to 00:35 in which a red rectangle of 100x100 pixels will appear in the middle.

### Usage
``
python3 graymatics_prob_3.py video_graymatics.mov
```
the video is also uploaded and named video_graymatics.mov
